# odin-sign-up-form
This is a project that is part of The Odin Project curriculum. 
It involves using novice/intermediate level HTML and CSS knowledge to create a sign-up form. 
This project will help me demonstrate my understanding of input types, form basics, form validation, regular expressions, and more advanced CSS techniques. 
Just as I have done with previous projects, I will do plan accordingly through the use of pencil and paper.
